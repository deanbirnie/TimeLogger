# Example CSV for JIRA Worklog Import
# This file shows the expected structure for the time logging script.
# The script:
# - Ignores the first 4 rows (including this comment block)
# - Extracts:
#     - Time spent from column C (`duration`)
#     - Date from column D and start time from column E to form the datetime
#     - Description from column G (removes everything after and including the `#`)
#     - JIRA issue key from column I (expects only one tag, like `#JIRA-123`)
# - Skips columns like `subtotals`, `tag_groups`, `stop`, `user`, etc.
# - Assumes durations are in HH:MM format and time is 24-hour clock
